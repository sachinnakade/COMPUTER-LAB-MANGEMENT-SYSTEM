# COMPUTER-LAB-MANGEMENT-SYSTEM
This project is a Computer Lab Student Entry Management System developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system is designed to streamline and digitize the process of recording student entries in a computer lab. Traditionally, lab entry records are maintained manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
